              disinfectants, and other applied science.

              the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.
              Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've
              been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.
              Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best
              breeds."
