              disinfectants, and other applied science.

              team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat -
              including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.

              <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world
              food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are
              the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.
              Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've
              been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.
              Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best
              breeds."
